Gene Ontology in Bionode

Will provide access to the public MySQL services of the Gene Ontology.

Have a look at go.js how to use go\_gene\_annotation.js to retrieve GO annotations for a particular gene. It's not much, but it's a start for your own explorations. All of GO can be queried via internet access to their MySQL server. Details and sample queries available here: http://amigo.geneontology.org/goose
<br>

<b>Note:</b> Another quick and dirty way to associate GO terms to target genes is the use of InterMine via their npm module. Alex from FlyMine wrote on 11/12/2014: "Sorry about the lack of good doc links on the NPM page - our API docs
are here: http://intermine.github.io/imjs/, and http://alexkalderimis.github.io/imjs/ (mine are sometimes
a little ahead of intermine's). I will make sure that they are more
discoverable in the future.

We also have some documentation here:
http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries

With some examples here:
http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/how-do-i/#howtows

If there are some examples you want to see, just let us know, and we
will add them to the how-do-I section."

All best,

Alex Kalderimis
